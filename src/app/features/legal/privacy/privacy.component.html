    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
        I take your privacy seriously. This policy explains how I collect, use, and protect your
        personal information.
    </p>

    <h5>Data I Collect</h5>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Email address (for login, account management, and notifications)</li>
        <li>IP address (for security and troubleshooting)</li>
        <li>Third-party authentication profile (if you log in with services like Google)</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>How I Use Your Data</h5>
    <p>
        Your information is used solely for authentication, security, and account management. I do
        not sell or share your data with marketers.
    </p>

    <h5>Data Retention</h5>
    <p>
        I retain personal data only as long as necessary to provide services or comply with legal
        obligations.
    </p>

    <h5>Cookies</h5>
    <p>
        I use only essential cookies to keep the site functional. Third-party services used for
        login may set cookies necessary for their functionality; these are not used for tracking or
        marketing.
    </p>

    <h5>Third-Party Services</h5>
    <p>
        When using third-party login services, certain technical data may be transmitted directly to
        the provider. I do not control this data; it is governed by the provider's privacy policy.
        By using these authentication services, you agree to the processing of your information as
        described by the respective providers.
    </p>

    <h5>Links to Other Sites</h5>
    <p>
        I have included links on this website for your use and reference. I am not responsible for
        the privacy policies on these websites. You should be aware that the privacy policies of
        these websites may differ from my own.
    </p>

    <h5>Security</h5>
    <p>
        The security of your personal information is important to me, but remember that no method of
        transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While I
        strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, I cannot
        guarantee its absolute security.
    </p>

    <h5>Your Rights</h5>
    <p>
        Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete your data.
        Contact me to exercise these rights.
    </p>

    <h5>Changes to This Policy</h5>
    <p>
        I reserve the right to update or change my Privacy Policy at any time and you should check
        this Privacy Policy periodically. If I make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, I
        will notify you either through the email address you have provided me, or by placing a
        prominent notice on my website.
    </p>
